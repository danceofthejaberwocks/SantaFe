My first codergirl assesment. The requirements are 


The user is welcomed to the restaurant, asked if they would prefer a booth or a table, asked if they would like a breakfast, lunch, or dinner menu, then presented with the chosen menu.
The menu items should load from an array that the code loops through.
Once the user chooses an item from the menu, they should be offered a selection of drinks. If they chose an adult beverage, ask for their date of birth then determine if they are old enough to order it or not.
As a bonus, the code could potentially total up the cost of the items ordered and suggest a tip amount.
All mechanics of the application should be processed using methods that pass information back and forth.
